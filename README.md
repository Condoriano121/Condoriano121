- 👋 Hi, I’m Condoriano
- 👀 I’m interested in videogames and sports
- 🌱 I’m currently learning godot on my own while I work as a junior full stack developer
- 💞️ I’m down to chat with anyone who seems friendly and who is interested in my hobbies
- 📫 mail: victorgtablon35@gmail.com
- ⚡ About me: I am a 21 years old student, I enjoy outdoors activities as well as staying at home with my computer. I would like to work as a programer full time but I am still learning, looking for improvement. I really enjoy learning new skills.
- ⚡ More about me: Right now I am struggling to concentrate on just doing one thing so I am trying to learn some discipline.
- Feel free to check my work :-) and have a great day!
